## Description

According to Wikipedia "A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. It is a web development concept, usually limited to a web application's client-side (including any web frameworks being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as SAPIs or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application.


A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request–response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web—most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server."

The Note Taker project is an assignment that asks for the web developer to create a note taking application using a pre-fab front end and add specific notes and have the user responses saved to local storage. The user then reviews the saved answers on the left side and can keep or delete and then moves on to the next question the user saves all of their desired notes.

The assignment is to modify starter code to create the application. This application uses Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Installation
